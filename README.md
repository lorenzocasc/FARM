The project involves creating a C program called 'farm' that facilitates communication between processes and threads as depicted in the provided logical architecture. The program consists of two processes: MasterWorker, a multi-threaded process with a Master thread and 'n' Worker threads, and Collector, generated by MasterWorker. They communicate via an AF_LOCAL socket connection.

MasterWorker reads a list of binary files containing long integers and optional arguments. It sends the file names to Worker threads through a concurrent queue. Each Worker reads the file content, computes a result based on the file's integers, and sends this result and the file name to Collector via the socket. Collector then outputs the results in ascending order based on the calculation.

Optional arguments for MasterWorker include the number of Worker threads, queue length, a directory name, and a delay between requests to Workers. The program should handle various signals, ensuring proper termination and printing of results up to that point. The project submission includes a zip file with separated code files, a Makefile with a 'test' target, and a brief report describing the implementation choices and additional tests.
